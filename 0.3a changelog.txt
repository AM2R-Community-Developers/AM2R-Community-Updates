Changelog from vanilla AM2R to Momentum Mod 0.3a:
MECHANICS CHANGES:
	RUNNING AND JUMPING:
		-Running responds to player input faster. (this does not apply when turning, so as to allow players to aim shots and position themselves more precisely.)
		-Speed increases gradually (starting from vanilla run speed) while running, even before acquiring speedbooster
		-Jumping before speedbooster is active will no longer cap your speed
		-While in spinjump state, there is no air friction, so you can maintain your speed. In normal jumping/falling state, you will slow down quickly, so respin to keep speed.
		-The faster you run, the higher you jump.
		-New sound effect and graphic that indicates speedbooster activation.
		-Upon landing, Samus will no longer stop in her tracks for 5 frames like she does in vanilla (this was likely done to mimic gba metroid movement.)
		-Added vertical spinjump from RoS and Super.
	BALL STATES:
		-Mockball is now possible before (and after) speedbooster, functions like super metroid. To activate, morph within 12 frames of landing.
		-Morphing in the air no longer halts vertical or horizontal speed (unmorphing does.)
		-Unmorphing on the ground while holding left or right will put the player straight into the running state, instead of crouch.
		-Note that in earlier versions of momentum mod, spider ball's speed was doubled. This change has since been reverted.
		-Spring ball is available from the start of the game.
OTHER:
	LEVEL DESIGN:
		-Power grip is no longer available from the start of the game.
			-Platform layouts before power grip is acquired has been altered to accomodate this change.
			-Arachnus now drops Power Grip instead of Spring Ball.


Changes from 0.2a to 0.3a:
-Made running, jumping, and landing MUCH more responsive and intuitive. This is the highlight of the update.
-Fixed arachnus CoreX dropping spring ball instead of power grip
-Fixed morph ball speedboost into the ground applying the wrong speed to the player.
-Fixed mockball speeds sometimes not translating to the player's prior airspeed. Added a minimum mockball speed.
-Fixed a bug where doing mockball at below speedbooster speed would allow you to store a shinespark, even without speedbooster.
-Fixed a bug where ballsparking into a slope would steal all of your speed.
